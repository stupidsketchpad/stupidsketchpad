hi there my name is paper :) i'm a biseuxal woman with uhh any pronouns. i like making things look pretty

i draw and rarelyy write. i don't usually post my art oopsie?? and you might see me at a lab roleplay or games

i've been in a lotta fandoms, and i switch them really quick. i'm trying to stick to hamilton and solarballs atm

i get nervous/awkward easily bear with me ðŸ˜“ i also don't go on ponytown too often so uhhh be wary of that? yay
